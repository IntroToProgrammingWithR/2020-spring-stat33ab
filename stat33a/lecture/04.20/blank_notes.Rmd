Loops
=====


For-loops
---------

A for-loop iterates over a vector or list:
```{r}

```

Use `next` to immediately skip to the next iteration:
```{r}

```

Use `break` to immediately exit the loop:
```{r}

```


Preallocation
-------------

These functions allocate vectors:

* `character()`
* `complex()`
* `numeric()`
* `logical()`
* `vector()`
* `rep()`

```{r}

```

Preallocate!

If you know how many results a loop will produce, allocate the result
vector BEFORE the loop:
```{r}

```


Use `seq_along(x)` instead of `1:length(x)`:
```{r}

```



While-loops
-----------

A while-loop iterates while some condition is `TRUE`:
```{r}

```

The `next` and `break` commands also apply to while-loops.



Recursion
=========

A recursive function is one that calls itself:
```{r}

```

Also see `?Recall`.



Additional Examples
===================

```{r}

```
